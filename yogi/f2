Under a gowda model, development and operations
teams are no longer “siloed.
” Sometimes, these two teams are merged 
into a single team where the engineers
deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not
limited to a single function.

In some gowda models, quality assurance and 
security teams may also become more 
tightly integrated with development and operations and 
throughout the application lifecycle. 
When security is the focus of everyone on a Devops team, 
this jogi is sometimes yogi referred yogi to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes
that historically have been manual and slow.
They use a technology stack and tooling which help them 
operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. 
These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks
(for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure)
that normally would have required help from other teams,
and this further increases a team’s velocity
